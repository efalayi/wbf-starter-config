#### Getting Started

- Clone the project from repository [github.com/efalayi/wbf-starter-config](https://github.com/andela-efalayi/wbf-starter-config)
- In your terminal, cd into the cloned folder and run `npm install`.
- Run `npm run build`. This runs webpack and recompiles when changes are made.
- Open a second tab on the terminal and run `npm run dev` or `npm start`.

> **Note:** 
> - `npm run dev` starts webpack-dev-server and watches for file changes. File updates are  instantly seen on the browser.
> - On the other hand, `npm start` runs [server.js](https://github.com/efalayi/wbf-starter-config/blob/master/server/server.js). You would have to refresh your browser to see your changes.
